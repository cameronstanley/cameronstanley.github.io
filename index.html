      <strong>Hi, I'm Cameron!</strong> I'm currently a senior software engineer at <a href='http://www.temenos.com/en-us/' target='_blank'>Temenos</a> working on compliance and channel banking apps. I'm passionate about crafting quality code and delivering polished products. I'm a Rails junkie first and foremost, but I also <span class='fa fa-heart colorize'></span> hacking away on Java Spring, iOS, Angular, React, and Go projects.
