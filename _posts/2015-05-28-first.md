I'm starting this blog to keep up with things I learn or find interesting related to programming and software engineering, with the hopes it will help someone else. I'm currently a senior software engineer at [Temenos](http://www.temenos.com/en-us/) working on banking channel products. I've primarily worked on projects written in Ruby on Rails, Java, and Objective-C, but lately I have been getting into Node.js, Go, and Swift. 

The plan is to churn out at least one entry per week, so be sure to keep an eye out for updates.
