I recently had some time over the holidays and decided I wanted to build a mobile app. At Fleetio, we use Circle CI to automatically run our test suites after every commit. I thought it would be useful to be able to monitor the status of my projects on the go, so I decided to create something to solve that problem. As a result, my mobile app All Green is now live in both the App Store and Google Play!
