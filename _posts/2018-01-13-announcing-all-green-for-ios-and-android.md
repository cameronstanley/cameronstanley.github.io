title: Announcing All Green for iOS and Android
tags: ios android ci
---

I recently had some time over the holidays and decided to build a mobile app. At [Fleetio](https://www.fleetio.com/), we use [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) to automatically run our test suites after every commit. I thought it would be useful to be able to monitor the status of my projects on the go, so I set out to create something to solve that problem. As a result, my mobile app All Green is now live in both the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/all-green/id1252330663?mt=8) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cameronstanley.all_green)!

All Green is the best way to stay up-to-date on the build statuses of projects being tested through Circle CI. Check failing builds and quickly identify failing tests to keep your projects in the green.

Features:

- List recent builds for all their projects
- View build status and details
- Retry failed builds
- Cancel currently running builds

I would greatly appreciate any feedback you on any bugs encountered or features that would improve the app!
