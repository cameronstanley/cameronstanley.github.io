title: Go - First Impressions
---

I recently started down the path of learning the Go programming language and wanted to share my experience so far.

# Why Go?
Go is typically labeled as a [systems programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming) language, making it a great tool for building CLIs and backend services that support other applications. It has concurrency baked in with goroutines and is also very fast. The strict compiler and static typing are welcome features coming from a Java background, making it a scalable language for larger projects. I see Go as another great addition to the programmer's toolbox, and I would advise anyone interested in growing their skill set to take a look at this great language.

# Pros
Easy syntax

# Cons

# Working on a Project
My first go project is go-reddit

# Learning Resources
* [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/list) offers an interactive tutorial that is a great way to get your feet wet with the language. I'd recommend starting here.
* [Code School](http://codeschool.com) recently launched a new course titled "On Track With Golang" that is a pretty great introduction to the language. Usually their courses are enough to only get the basic syntax of a language down, but I found myself feeling like I had a significant handle on Go once I finished it. If you have an account, definitely spend the time to go through this one.
* [awesome-go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go) is a curated list of Go packages that you can use in your projects. It's always nice to have one of these when exploring a new community to see what is available and to get some quality real-world examples.
* [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/) is the official documentation host for Go packages. Any open-source project on GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket has its documentation published here and is in a clean viewable format. Very useful when importing and using an open-source package in your project.
