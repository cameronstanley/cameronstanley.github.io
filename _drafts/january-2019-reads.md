title: Books I Read in 2019
---

In 2019 I set a goal to read one book per week, but at the close of the year I'm sitting at 45 out of 52 books. Even though I fell short of my original target, I read more this year than I ever have in my life and I'm grateful for all the experience and knowledge I have gained in the process. I wholeheartedly believe reading is one of the most productive hobbies one can have and in 2020 I plan to continue pursuing it.

I switched from primarily listening to audiobooks to also reading physical books and digital books on my phone. I usually read several books concurrently, one for each medium. I prefer to read technical or fiction books 

Going forward in 2020, I hope to be more intentional with my reading selections. Specifically, I would like to read:

* The Bible
* Technical and Management Books
* Classic Literature - Fyodor Dostoevsky, Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck
* Philosophy - Plato, Camus, Nietzsche
